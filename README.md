## Overview

Sushi Shop is a full-stack monolith application for online food ordering.
It covers the full order lifecycle: browsing the menu, placing an order,
payment, and real-time delivery tracking.

The system supports three roles:
- **User** — browsing, ordering, tracking
- **Admin** — managing products, promotions, orders, audit logs
- **Courier** — managing assigned deliveries and updating delivery statuses

## Features

### Storefront
- Product catalog with categories, search, images, reviews, and ratings
- Active promotions with automatic discount calculation
- Shopping cart and checkout
- Order tracking with real-time status updates via WebSocket
- Stripe payment integration
- User profile management
- JWT authentication with email verification
- Google OAuth2 login
- Responsive design

### Admin Panel
- Full product CRUD with image management
- Promotion management with conflict prevention
- Order management with status workflow
- Real-time order updates via WebSocket
- Audit logs with filtering

### Courier Panel
- Order management dashboard
- Delivery status transitions

## Key Engineering Highlights

- **Feature-based architecture** — organized the monolith by business domains with clear separation of controllers, services, repositories, DTOs, and mappers
- **Database optimization** — eliminated N+1 queries using `EntityGraph`, batch fetching, and targeted database indexes
- **Dynamic filtering** — implemented composable filtering with Spring Data JPA Specifications for products, orders, and audit logs
- **Promotion conflict prevention** — prevents a product from being assigned to multiple active promotions
- **Real-time order tracking** — WebSocket/STOMP updates order status automatically across clients
- **Cross-cutting audit logging** — implemented with a custom `@Auditable` annotation and AOP
- **Role-based access control** — separate workflows and permissions for User, Admin, and Courier roles
- **API rate limiting** — configurable request throttling using Bucket4j
- **Drag-and-drop image reordering** — admin can reorder product images
- **Service layer separation** — split large services into focused services (OrderCreationService, OrderQueryService, ProductImageService, ReviewReplyService)
- **Validation hierarchy** — custom exceptions for all HTTP error scenarios with centralized handling
- **Token management** — separate TokenService for verification and password reset tokens
- **Scheduled cleanup** — automated cleanup of expired tokens and rate-limit buckets
- **Email verification flow** — async email sending with styled HTML templates

## Testing

The optional AI setup is documented in [docs/ai-rag.md](docs/ai-rag.md) and
[docs/ai-agent.md](docs/ai-agent.md).

- **Unit tests:** JUnit 5 + Mockito — services, mappers, validators, aspects
- **Integration tests:** Testcontainers with real PostgreSQL — Flyway migrations, repository queries
- **Controller tests:** MockMvc — REST API endpoints
- **Rate limiting tests:** Bucket4j token bucket behavior

| Role    | Email             | Password |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| User    | user@test.com     | user     |
| Admin   | admin@test.com    | admin    |
| Courier | courier@test.com  | courier  |

## Development data

After PostgreSQL is running and Flyway has applied the schema, seed the local database with:

```powershell
.\seed.cmd
```

The command recreates 30 consistent development records in every application table. It is safe to run repeatedly, but it replaces existing application data. Flyway history is left untouched, and the dedicated Compose Redis cache is cleared after a Docker seed.

The script automatically uses the running Docker Compose PostgreSQL service. To force a connection through locally installed `psql`, run:

```powershell
.\seed.cmd -Mode Local
```
